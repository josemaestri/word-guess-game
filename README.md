My take on Hangman. Presenting: Beerman!

## Steps
* Press the Start Button
* Type letters to begin guessing; Hint: all the available words to guess are beer styles!
* If correct, your letter will appear in the blanks
* If incorrect, you will see your guess in the section below the blanks, the available guesses will decrease by 1, and the beer man will continue to materialize

## Notes
* When you successfully guess all the letters, you win! And you'll be able to start a new game by pressing OK in the following alert box, and you will score a point!
* When you run out of available guesses, the beer man will be fully visible and you lose. And you'll be able to start a new game by pressing OK in the following alert box.
* You are free to restart during any game, and it will not affect your score. Only refreshing the page will reset your score.


## Good luck!
